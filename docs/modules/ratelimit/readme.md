## Disclaimer

Rate limiting in Fortress hardens the security of a website. However, nothing in the rate-limiting module of Fortress is meant to be used for DOS protection, like flooding a server with a massive amount of requests.

This is impossible to tackle effectively at the application layer and should be handled at the server or CDN level.

## Implementation details

Before you start diving into the applications of Fortress's rate-limiting module, you might like to dive into
the [implementation details](implementation.md) of our custom Rate Limiter.

## Applications
