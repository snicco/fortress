## Introduction

> Before diving deeper, it's essential to have a grasp of the [session management](session-managment-and-security.md)
> principles.
> This provides context on how the sudo mode fits within the broader framework.

The Fortress sudo mode mirrors the concept of the Linux [`sudo`](https://www.sudo.ws/) command.
Essentially, after a user logs in, there's a
specific period where the user's session operates in a high-privileged state.

This heightened session privilege lasts for a [set duration](session-managment-and-security.md#configuration-3).
Once this [sudo timeout](session-managment-and-security.md#the-sudo-mode-timeout) expires, Fortress transitions the
user's session from a high-privileged to a low-privileged state.

This means certain sensitive actions become restricted
unless the user re-confirms their credentials.

The essence of this mechanism relies on two main components:

- protected capabilities
- and protected pages.

We'll delve deeper into these shortly.

> Note: It's crucial to understand that the user remains logged in the entire time.
> Only specific sensitive actions are limited, while non-sensitive tasks continue uninterrupted.

## How the Sudo Mode Works in Practice

### 1. Session in Sudo Mode

Upon logging in, the user's session instantly activates the sudo mode. In this state:

- The user has full capabilities, allowing them to perform any action that they normally could on the site.
- This unrestricted access persists for the sudo timeout's duration, which is 15
  minutes [by default](session-managment-and-security.md#configuration-3).
- Visually, the admin dashboard appears as usual.

### 2. Approaching Sudo Mode Expiry

As this privileged mode approaches its conclusion:

- A lightweight JS script added by Fortress to the admin footer alerts the user when
  only 1 minute remains before sudo mode expiration.

![Screenshot of the admin dashboard with the sudo mode about to expire](../../_assets/images/session/sudo-about-to-expire.png)

- Rather than relying on a static countdown, Fortress fetches timeout details from the server via AJAX, updating every
  10 seconds.
  Adjust this frequency through the
  [`non_sudo_mode_recheck_frequency`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#non_sudo_mode_recheck_frequency)
  option.

**Note**: Fortress initiates these checks only when less than 60 seconds remain in the sudo mode.

![Screenshot of the admin dashboard where sudo mode is being rechecked](../../_assets/images/session/rechecking-permissions.png)

- At any point, users can select the alert in the admin bar, guiding them to a new tab. Here, they can verify their
  identity and renew the sudo timer.

If a user doesn't act, the sudo mode ends, and permissions decrease.

### 3. Reduced Permissions — A Session Outside Sudo Mode

If users don't re-authenticate prior to the sudo timeout:

- The session's limited permission state is highlighted by Fortress,
  which continues to monitor and update the sudo mode status.

![Screenshot of the admin area with restricted permissions](../../_assets/images/session/sudo-mode-reduced-permissions.png)

- With reduced permissions, users can't execute highly sensitive tasks.
  This restriction is implemented by filtering out all set [protected capabilities](#protected-capabilities) at runtime.
- Fortress employs official WordPress APIs for these operations, ensuring seamless functionality.

Consider a scenario where a user accesses the post overview page:

- While editing and viewing remain available, specific functions, such as bulk post deletion (
  a [protected capability](#protected-capabilities)), are disabled.
- WordPress automatically removes certain functionalities and menu items, like the "Settings" and "Plugins" menu items
  are no longer visible.

![Screenshot of the WordPress post edit page](../../_assets/images/session/post-edit-permissions.png)

If a user, despite the missing "Settings" menu item tries accessing `/wp-admin/options-general.php` -
a [protected page](#protected-pages) - Fortress intercepts and redirects them:

![Screenshot of the Confirm Access](../../_assets/images/session/confirm-access.png)

Providing correct credentials resets the sudo timer, and the user gets redirected to their intended destination.

## Protected Capabilities

Fortress recognizes the following capabilities as protected. As a result, only users in sudo mode can execute them.

It's worth noting that most of these capabilities are typically reserved for administrators.
Hence, **everyday users or content editors will largely remain unaffected by these restrictions**.

### Configuring Protected Capabilities

You have two methods at your disposal to alter the list of protected capabilities:

1. **Custom List:** Begin with a blank slate by defining your unique list of protected capabilities. You can achieve
   this using the
   [`protected_capabilities`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#protected_capabilities) option.<br>
   ⚠️ Be cautious: Utilizing this method will overwrite Fortress's default protected capabilities!
2. **Using WordPress Hooks:** This method allows you to add or remove specific capabilities using WordPress hooks.

```php
<?php

/*
* Plugin Name: Customize Fortress's Protected Capabilities
*/

use Snicco\Enterprise\Fortress\Session\Infrastructure\Event\DeterminingProtectedCapabilities;

add_action(DeterminingProtectedCapabilities::class, function (DeterminingProtectedCapabilities $event) :void {
    
    // Add a single capability.
    $event->addProtectedCapability('my_custom_capability');
    // Add multiple capabilities.
    $event->addProtectedCapability('my_custom_capability_1', 'my_custom_capability_2');
   
   // Remove a single capability.
    $event->removeProtectedCapability('my_custom_capability');
    // Remove multiple capabilities.
    $event->removeProtectedCapability('my_custom_capability_1', 'my_custom_capability_2');
}
```

**Key Point:** Ensure your hook callback is initialized before the `plugins_loaded` hook gets triggered.

To incorporate the callback, you can either place it in a custom plugin or within a must-use plugin. However, **don't
attempt to add it to the theme's functions.php** file — it's too late in the process and will not function correctly.

## Protected Pages

Within Fortress, a "protected page" can solely be accessed by users whose session is in "sudo mode."
Those operating in non-sudo mode are redirected to the "Confirm Access" page.

Protected pages are determined by inspecting the URL path of the current request.

By default, these are the pages Fortress marks as protected.
It's important to note that the majority of these pages are
primarily accessible to administrators:

| Path                                 | Functionality & Usage                                                                                       |

| `/wp-admin/user-new.php`             | Adds new users to the site.                                                                                 |
| `/wp-admin/profile.php`              | Allows users to edit their own profile and settings.                                                        |
| `/wp-admin/update.php`               | Processes updates for plugins, themes, and the WordPress core.                                              |

For those utilizing **WordPress Multisite**, additional protected pages come into play:

| Page                               | Functionality & Usage                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/wp-admin/network.php`            | Displays the main dashboard of the Network Admin for multisite installations.              |
| `/wp-admin/ms-admin.php`           | Deprecated network admin file; rarely used in recent versions.                             |
| `/wp-admin/ms-delete-site.php`     | Allows for the deletion of a subsite within the multisite network.                         |
| `/wp-admin/ms-edit.php`            | Allows for the editing of a particular site's settings within the multisite network.       |

| `/wp-admin/ms-upgrade-network.php` | Handles the upgrading process for the entire network when WordPress core updates are made. |
| `/wp-admin/network/*`              | Represents a wildcard for various other network administration tasks and settings.         |

### Configuring Protected Pages

You have two methods at your disposal to alter the list of protected capabilities:

1. **Custom List:** Begin with a blank slate by defining your unique list of protected pages.
   You can achieve this using the
   [`protected_pages`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#protected_pages) option.<br>
   ⚠️ Be cautious: Utilizing this method will overwrite Fortress's default protected pages!
2. **Using WordPress Hooks:** This method allows you to add specific pages using WordPress hooks.

```php
<?php

/*
* Plugin Name: Customize Fortress's Protected Pages
*/

use Snicco\Enterprise\Fortress\Session\Infrastructure\Event\ConfirmingSudoMode;

add_action(ConfirmingSudoMode::class, function (ConfirmingSudoMode $event) :void {
    $event->addProtectedPath('/my-account');
    
    // "*" Can be used as a wildcard.
    $event->addProtectedPath('/parent-page/*');
})
```

#### Wildcards

In defining paths, the * symbol acts as a wildcard, offering broad match possibilities.

For instance:

- `/wp-admin/*` will match the entire WordPress admin domain.
- `/post-*` matches paths like `/post-1`, `/post-2`, and even `/post-1/child/sub-child`.

## Distinguishing Between Protected Capabilities & Protected Pages

At a glance, both "Protected Capabilities" and "Protected Pages" might seem similar, but they serve distinct purposes:
the former revolves around security, while the latter enhances usability.

### The Nuances

**1. Protected Capabilities:**

- These primarily ensure security by dictating who can perform certain actions.
- If you solely use protected capabilities without protected pages, users might encounter not so pretty error displays.

**2. Protected Pages:**

- These focus on user experience by ensuring users don't stumble upon confusing (WordPress) error pages.
- Fortress redirects users to the "Confirm Access" page, where they can re-authenticate and renew their sudo mode.

### Visualizing the Difference

**1. Standard WordPress Error:**

- By default, if WordPress detects a missing permission, it shows the "wp_die" page.

![Screenshot of the default wp_die page](../../_assets/images/session/wp_die.png)

- To put it bluntly, it's not the most pleasant user experience.

**2. Fortress's Enhanced UX:**

- In contrast, Fortress redirects users to a more approachable "Confirm Access" page.

![Screenshot of the confirm access page](../../_assets/images/session/confirm-access.png)

**3. Edge Case:**

- If a user tries accessing a page that requires a protected capability but isn't a protected page, Fortress detects this
  and enhances the default wp_die page with a link to the "Confirm Access" page.

## Testing the sudo mode

It is cumbersome to test that your sudo mode configuration works as expected
since it has a time-based component and requires you to wait out the sudo timeout.

For this reason, Fortress includes a WP-CLI command that will toggle the sudo mode status of a user's most recently
created session.

```shell
wp snicco/fortress session toggle-sudo <user_id>
```

Refer to the [complete command reference here](../../wp-cli/readme.md#toggle-sudo).
