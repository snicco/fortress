## Terminology

- TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password
- OTP: One-Time Password
- 2FA: Two-Factor Authentication

## Interaction with Core and plugins

### When is 2FA enforced?

Fortress hooks into the [`authenticate`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/authenticate/) hook that is
fired by
the [`wp_signon`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_signon/) / [`wp_authenticate`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_authenticate/)
function.

Fortress's TOTP functionality runs if any primary authentication is successful. Successful means that the `authenticate`
hook passes a `WP_User`).

A primary authentication method might be any of the following:

- username/password.
- username/email.
- application passwords.
- custom and or third-party mechanisms.

Fortress is indifferent toward the primary authentication method and the "request type" (HTTP, XML-RPC, REST-API, etc.).

Fortress will perform the following steps IF the user already has TOTP-2FA [configured](#ui-setup-walkthrough):

1. The login attempt is intercepted, and WordPress will not set authentication cookies.
2. Fortress creates and persists a cryptographically secure TOTP login challenge for the user.
3. Fortress redirects the user to the challenge URL.
4. PHP is shut down.
5. The user enters his current OTP.
6. On success, Fortress redirects the user to his intended post-login location from step 1.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Skipping 2FA for the current request

You can use the following code snippet to make Fortress skip the TOTP-2FA check. In this case, the authentication will
succeed as if Fortress was not installed.

We do not advise this, and you should avoid using automated authentication methods like application passwords for
high-privilege user accounts requiring 2FA.

```php
use Snicco\Enterprise\Fortress\Auth\TOTP\Infrastructure\Event\DeterminingIf2FaShouldBeSkipped;

add_action(DeterminingIf2FaShouldBeSkipped::class, function (DeterminingIf2FaShouldBeSkipped $event): void {
    
    $some_condition = false;    
        
    if($some_condition){
        $event->should_skip_2fa = true;
    }

});



```

### Changing the redirect context

Fortress tries to parse the intended post-login redirect location from the current environment.

Fortress consecutively checks the `$_REQUEST` super global for the following keys:

- `redirect_to`. Used by WordPress Core and many plugins as a hidden form field.
- `_wp_http_referer`.
- `HTTP_REFERER`

If the `$_REQUEST` does not contain one of the above keys, Fortress will use
the [`get_edit_profile_url`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_edit_profile_url/) function as a
fallback.

You can customize the redirect location using the following code snippet, if your site uses a custom login scheme or
third-party plugin that does not use any of the above request keys:

```php
use Snicco\Enterprise\Fortress\Auth\TOTP\Infrastructure\Event\Determining2FARedirectContext;

add_action(Determining2FARedirectContext::class, function (Determining2FARedirectContext $event) :void {
   $event->redirect_too = '/some-other-page';
});
```

### Ajax-powered login forms

If your site uses a third-party plugin that has an ajax-powered login form, a redirect flow will not work 
since the ajax request would follow the redirect, but the user would not see the challenge page.

Fortress tries its best to detect it "ajax-like"
requests and returns a `WP_Error` object with the link to the challenge page if it does.

Most likely, the plugin will render the error object in its front-end login form and the user can proceed by clicking
the link.

If the third-party plugin shows a generic error message,
there's nothing Fortress can do about it as it does not have control over the output of other plugins.

The following signals are taken into account to determine if the request is "ajax-like":

- The `X-Requested-With` header is set to `XMLHttpRequest`.
- The `Content-Type` header starts with `application/json`.
- `WP_DOING_AJAX` is set to `true` which is the case for all requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
- The `REQUEST_URI` starts with `/wp-json/` ([rest_get_url_prefix](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/rest_get_url_prefix/))

If this detection mechanism does not work for your site, you can use the following event
to implement your own logic.

```php
use Snicco\Enterprise\Fortress\Auth\TOTP\Infrastructure\Event\RedirectingUserWith2FAEnabled;

add_action(RedirectingUserWith2FAEnabled::class, function (RedirectingUserWith2FAEnabled $event) :void {
   // Force return a WP_Error object with the challenge URL. 
   $event->turnRedirectIntoWPError();
   
   // Force return a redirect to the challenge URL.
   // $event->useRedirect();
});
```

### Enforcing 2FA pre login

If a site only has one (or a handful)
of [`privileged_users`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#privileged_user_roles) AND new privileged
users are added infrequently, it makes sense to enforce that each user needs to have TOTP-2FA configured BEFORE he can
log in.

Doing this protects against the following attack vectors:

- An attack with WRITE access to the database can't delete TOTP credentials to bypass 2FA.
- An attacker with WRITE access to the database can't insert new admin users since they can't create TOTP credentials
  without the [secret key stored in the filesystem](../../getting-started/02_preparation.md#secrets).
- An attacker with a [stolen auth cookie](../session/session-managment-and-security.md#threat-model) can not create
  sleeper admin users.
- A **non-targeted malware** can not insert new admin users using `wp_insert_user`. <br>(If an attacker specifically
  targets your site AND your site has a vulnerability that gives full OS access, it's game over no matter what).

To achieve this, add your
site's [`privileged_user_roles`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#privileged_user_roles) to
the [`require_2fa_for_roles_before_login`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#require_2fa_for_roles_before_login)
option AFTER all privileged users have 2FA configured.

Any privileged user without TOTP-2FA configured will then see the following message when they attempt to log in:

| ![TOTP setup required pre login](../../_assets/images/auth/2fa-required-pre-login.png) |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Why does Fortress use a redirect to enforce TOTP-2FA?

This method has the highest compatibility with WordPress Core and all the hundreds of plugins that allow front-end user
login.

An HTTP redirect will always work whether your site uses WooCommerce, the default login page, or something entirely
different.

In contrast, using a JavaScript-based solution is bound to fail for all login forms besides the native one.
Unfortunately, WordFence made this mistake; hence, its 2FA only works on the default login page.

### The user can log in without 2FA !?

Your site uses a plugin that, with almost 100% certainty, bypasses the default WordPress authentication mechanism (
adding custom hooks to  [`authenticate`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/authenticate/)) and directly
calls [`wp_set_auth_cookie`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_set_auth_cookie/).

The following example showcases the issue:

```php
function my_plugin_maybe_log_in_whitelisted_ip_directly() {

    if(true){
       return; // DON'T COPY AND PASTE THIS CODE.
    }
        
    if($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] === '0.0.0.0') {
        // WordPress and, by extension Fortress does not know about this login attempt.
        wp_set_auth_cookie(1); 
    }    
        
}
```

Fortress does not support this (incorrect) code, but few plugins make this mistake.

## Implementation

The Fortress TOTP implementation conforms with the [RFC 6238 spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6238) and works
with all common authenticator apps like:

- 1Password
- Google Authenticator
- etc.

### Rate Limiting 2FA attempts

Not a single WordPress plugin that does TOTP-2FA implements this, although the entire security of TOTP stands and falls
with this. **An implementation without 2FA rate limiting is broken.**

Contrary to popular opinion, the thirty-second validity window used by most TOTP implementations does not matter from a
brute-force perspective.

The time to brute-force TOTP is calculated using the following formula:

| ![TOTP brute force math](../../_assets/images/auth/totp-brute-force-math.png)<br>Go [here](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/6-digit-otp-for-two-factor-auth-is-brute-forceable-in-3-days/) to see how this formula is derived. |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

> The thirty-second window does not appear at all in this formula.

Let's look at concrete examples:

- A TOTP typically consists of six-digits => `numberOfPossibilities = 10^6 = 1 million`
- You are on a good server that can handle ten requests per second => `requestsPerSecond = 10`
- We want a 90% chance of successfully brute-forcing the TOTP implementation => `chanceOfSuccess = 0.9`

Substituting in the above formula gives us => `~ 230258 seconds` => `~ 64 hours`.

Even worse, you typically want the OTP from the previous thirty-second window to be valid for UX reasons which
effectively doubles the request rate since you are guessing two numbers at once (one for the current window, one for the
previous window).

If your server can handle ten requests per second, **an attacker can brute-force the TOTP implementation in `32 hours`,
90% of the time.**

If the compromised username/password pair belongs to a high-value user, an attacker will take the time and break the
2FA.

If you don't assume that a username/password pair can be compromised by any means, why are you using 2FA at all?

Fortress has your back, even though none of the "competing" WordPress plugins seem even to be aware of the problem!

| ![TOTP lockout warning](../../_assets/images/auth/2fa-lockout.png) |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

By default, Fortress allows five failed 2FA attempts. This can be configured with
the [`max_totp_attempts_before_lockout`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#max_totp_attempts_before_lockout)
option.
The failed attempts counter is reset after a successful 2FA login, **unless** the user is considered privileged.

If the threshold is exceeded, Fortress will "lock" the user account which means:

- Destroying all sessions (including the current one) for the associated user.
- Resetting the password of the user to a completely random one.
- Sending the user an email about the incident.

For privileged users, the failed attempts can only be reset by using
the: `wp snicco/fortress auth totp:reset-failed-attempts` [command](../../wp-cli/readme.md#totpreset-failed-attempts).

### Replay / Reuse protection

Many TOTP implementations (including Fortress) validate a user-provided OTP against the current AND previous time
window.

At any given time, two different OTPs are valid to prevent UX issues where a slight transmission delay makes the user
tip over the current time window leading to a failed attempt.

However, almost nobody protects against replaying/reusing an already-used OTP.

Fortress will never allow the same OTP to be used twice during the thirty-second validation window.

### TOTP secrets

The security of TOTP-based 2FA relies on the premise that the TOTP secret key is kept private between the server and the
user's authenticator app.

An attacker with access to the secret key will always be able to generate valid OTPs and thus break the 2FA.

Fortress generates the plaintext secret using 256 bits of entropy
and stores it in the database
using [libsodiums symmetric encryption](https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.sodium-crypto-stream-xor.php). The
encryption key is never stored in the database and must be provided using one
of [Fortress's secret storages.](../../getting-started/02_preparation.md#secrets).

### Recovery codes

TOTP recovery codes have 192 bits of entropy and are stored hashed
using [libsodiums BLAKE2b hashing](https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.sodium-crypto-generichash.php).

## UI setup walkthrough

### Force-setup screen

After a user whose role mandates TOTP-2FA logs in, they will be intercepted and redirected to the TOTP setup page.

| ![TOTP setup](../../_assets/images/auth/totp-setup.png) |
|---------------------------------------------------------|

The user will only be able to go to a different page after completing the TOTP setup.

Optionally, for emergencies, the user can skip the TOTP setup ONCE for the duration configured with
the [`skip_2fa_setup_duration_seconds`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#skip_2fa_setup_duration_seconds)
option.

### Completion screen

After clicking the "Setup two-factor authentication" button, Fortress will generate and persist a new set of TOTP
credentials for the user.

The user can scan the displayed QR code (if the authenticator app supports it) or copy the revealed secret.

**There is no way to see the secret again!**

| ![TOTP completion](../../_assets/images/auth/totp-complete.png) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

To prevent account lockout through some mismatch between Fortress and the authenticator app, Fortress will not activate
TOTP-2FA until the user provides a valid OTP.

### Delayed completion screen

If for some reason, the user does not complete the setup immediately, they can resume it later.
Fortress will automatically intercept all requests and redirect the user to the appropriate page.

Fortress will not reveal the current TOTP secret again. However, if the user has not saved it, they can resume the setup
with new credentials.

| ![TOTP completion](../../_assets/images/auth/totp-complete-delayed.png) |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Recovery codes screen

After providing the correct OTP for the current time window, Fortress will activate TOTP-2FA for the user and reveal
eight recovery codes.

The user can use each recovery code once if they lose access to their authenticator device.

The user must save the recovery codes to a secure location like a password manager right away, as Fortress does not have
access to the plaintext recovery codes ever again.

| ![TOTP completion](../../_assets/images/auth/totp-recovery-codes.png) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Management screen

The TOTP management page currently allows the authenticated user to:

- [Generate new recovery codes](#generating-new-recovery-codes)
- [Deactivate TOTP](#deactivating-totp)
- [Activate TOTP](#activating-totp)

#### Access

Authenticated users can access their management page by clicking a link on their profile page. If your site does not
allow WP-admin access to some users, you can use the shortcode below to render a direct link to the management page.

- `[snicco-fortress:manage_totp_link]`
- With a custom
  message:<br>`[snicco-fortress:manage_totp_link]Click here to edit 2FA[/snicco-fortress:manage_totp_link]`

| ![Profile page link](../../_assets/images/auth/totp-profile-link.png) | ![Manage TOTP page](../../_assets/images/auth/manage-totp.png) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|

Furthermore, administrators can manage the TOTP settings for other users.

| On the user-edit page<br><br>![Profile page link](../../_assets/images/auth/mange-totp-link-for-other-user.png) | Manage TOTP for a different user as admin.<br><br>![Manage TOTP page for other](../../_assets/images/auth/manage-totp-for-other-user.png) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Generating new recovery codes

Users can generate eight new recovery codes if they lose their current ones or assume they are compromised.

Fortress will invalidate all existing recovery codes for the user and [display the new ones](#recovery-codes-screen).

#### Deactivating TOTP

A user can deactivate TOTP for his account unless the user's role is specified in
the [`require_2fa_for_roles_before_login`](../../configuration/02_configuration_reference.md#require_2fa_for_roles_before_login)
option.

| ![TOTP completion](../../_assets/images/auth/deactivated-totp.png) |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

A user can re-enable TOTP at any time.<br>If TOTP is [enforced](#force-setup-screen) for the user's role, they will be
redirected to the [Force setup screen](#force-setup-screen) immediately when they try to navigate to a new page.

#### Activating TOTP

Every user on the site can access the management page, indecently of this current TOTP status.

A user that does not have TOTP enabled yet can [initiate the TOTP setup flow](#completion-screen) here.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

## CLI setup walkthrough

Since Fortress has 100% feature parity between UI and CLI, the same steps from
the [UI walkthrough](#ui-setup-walkthrough) can also be performed
using [Fortress's WP-CLI commands](../../wp-cli/readme.md).

### Setup command

- [Full command reference](../../wp-cli/readme.md#totpsetup).

```console
$ wp snicco/fortress auth totp:setup admin@snicco.io
                                                                                                                      
Secret: 7UQUJXREMBUWZOLEVG6LKI7G53Z4LNCS
```

Fortress writes the TOTP secret to stdout, and the user must copy-paste it into their authenticator app to generate
valid OTPs.

### Complete command

- [Full command reference](../../wp-cli/readme.md#totpcomplete).

A valid OTP needs to be provided the complete the setup.

```console
$ wp snicco/fortress auth totp:complete admin@snicco.io 755412
